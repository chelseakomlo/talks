# Mobile Surveillance

## Or, why we can call cell phones "tracking devices"

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Continuously tracking

Mobile phones continuously transmit and register with the nearest base station.

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Signals transmitted over short ranges include:
- GPS
- Wifi
- Bluetooth

These constant “pings” cannot be turned off (even if a phone is in airplane mode)

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## So, how is this used for physical surveillance?

<h2>Real time Call Detail Records (CDRs)</h2>

"Call detail records" ("CDRs") are the official billing records for a telephone company about call activity -- the incoming/outgoing calls made and received.

These records include: date/time, number dialed or called from, length of call, whether the call was completed.

CDRS will also identify the cellular "base station" that serviced the call for mobile calls (therefore revealing location at the time of the call).

CDRs do not record the voice content of phone calls, but SMS messaging text is sometimes stored.

Every call made or received generates a CDR record

Data services, such as SMS messaging and Internet access, also generate CDRs.
For example, when apps on your phone access the Internet without explicit action by you, these are also generating CDRS even though you are not actively using your phone.

CDRS are stored anywhere for a couple years to forever, depending on company policy (no regulations on this).

This is _retroactive_ action- investigators can see the action of a user even before they came to the attention of the authorities.

## Call Detail Records (CDRs)

Each year, over a million CDRs are requested by the police, and have been used as evidence in court cases about the location of a suspect at a particular time.

Information in a CDR:

- Location (of connected cell tower)
- Number of the caller and receiver
- Number of the receiver
- Billing information for the originating number
- Call duration

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Pen register/ Trap and Trace

- CDRs reveal past behavior.
- However, the same information in a CDR can be delivered in real time.
- Phone company switches are required to include a "lawful access" interface, that can deliver call information in real time.
- Also known as the "CALEA interface" or "J-STD-25 interface."
- Includes cell site information, revealing location in real time.

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Cell location & E911 Pings

- Your phone continuously scans for and registers with the closest base station
- The last base station you connected to is stored in a central database
- This information can be delivered in real time to law enforcement on a continous basis
- Current phones are required to have the capacity to calculate location within a few meters (for 911 calls)

<h3>Cell tower dumps</h3>

<img width="60%" src="images/tower-dump.jpg">

<p class="citation"> source: USA Today, http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/08/cellphone-data-spying-nsa-police/3902809/</p>

<h2> Cell tower dumps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One in four law enforcement agencies have used this technique</li>
  <li>Reveals the identity, location, and activity of thousands of people who connected to a cell tower at a particular date & time.</li>
  <li>A typical dump contains multiple towers, wireless providers, and can net information from thousands of phones</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
Note:
~ 1/4 law-enforcement agencies have used a "tower dump," giving police data about the identity, activity and location of any phone that connects to the targeted cellphone towers over a set span of time.

A typical dump covers multiple towers, and wireless providers, and info from thousands of phones.

Useful if law enforcement don't know a particular telephone number to ask for (i.e, they might want to identify potential suspects who were in a particular location at a specific time).

A tower dump lists the CDRs for a particular base station over some time period. That is, it is effectively a list of all the telephones and call activity in an area at a particular time.

## All of the above has been legal

Of course, we also know there are covert operations to illegally compromise mobile communications as well.

## One example we know of: Stealing SIM encryption keys (in the millions)

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Why is this effective?

Your phone relies on symmetric cryptography. So your phone has a copy of a secret key, and your provider has the other.

By stealing the secret key from the provider, all encrypted communication is able to be deciphered.

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## Conclusion

- Lots of fundamentally things broken with phones
- Problems like location tracking can't be fixed at a higher level

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
## P.S.

- Should we give up on mobile altogether?
- Is there anything that we can use phones safely for with higher-level solutions?
